/**
 * 2. Consider the prime number 11. Note that 13 is also a prime and 13 â€“ 11 =
 * 2. So, 11 and 13 are
 * known as twin primes. Similarly, 29 and 31 are twin primes. So is 71 and 73.
 * However, there are
 * many primes for which there is no twin. Examples are 23, 67. A twin array is
 * defined to an array
 * which every prime that has a twin appear with a twin. Some examples are
 * {3, 5, 8, 10, 27},
 * // 3 and 5 are twins and both are present
 * {11, 9, 12, 13, 23},
 * // 11 and 13 are twins and both are present, 23 has no twin
 * {5, 3, 14, 7, 18, 67}.
 * // 3 and 5 are twins, 5 and 7 are twins, 67 has no twin
 * The following are NOT twin arrays:
 * {13, 14, 15, 3, 5}
 * {1, 17, 8, 25, 67}
 * // 13 has a twin prime and it is missing in the array
 * // 17 has a twin prime and it is missing in the array
 * Write a function named isTwin(int[ ] arr) that returns 1 if its array
 * argument is a Twin array, otherwise
