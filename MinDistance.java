/**
 * 1. Write a function named minDistance that returns the smallest distance
 * between two factors of a
 * number. For example, consider 13013 = 1*7*11*13. Its factors are 1, 7, 11, 13
 * and 13013.
 * minDistance(13013) would return 2 because the smallest distance between any
 * two factors is 2 (13 -
 * 11 = 2). As another example, minDistance (8) would return 1 because the
 * factors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, 8
 * and the smallest distance between any two factors is 1 (2 – 1 = 1).
 * The function signature is
 * int minDistance(int n)
